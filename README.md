# Open Source Swarm Intelligence

## Brief Description:
This repositiory is for the code, paper and files for swarm intelligence research I conducted at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology under Dr. Michael Wollowski. Future Students are encouraged to build the robots and conduct research on swarm intelligence. The robots are originally from Kevin Thomas (user tristomietitoredeituit) on Thingiverse
